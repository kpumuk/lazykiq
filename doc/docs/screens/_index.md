Each screen focuses on a specific Sidekiq workflow. Use the view keys to
switch between them.

## Shared navigation

Most list screens use the same table controls:

| Key             | Description                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| `Up` / `k`      | Move up one row.            |
| `Down` / `j`    | Move down one row.          |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Page up or down.            |
| `g` / `G`       | Jump to top or bottom.      |
| `Left` / `h`    | Scroll table left.          |
| `Right` / `l`   | Scroll table right.         |
| `Home` / `0`    | Scroll to the first column. |
| `End` / `$`     | Scroll to the last column.  |

Filter dialogs share a few keys:

| Key          | Description         |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `Enter`      | Apply filter.       |
| `Ctrl+u`     | Clear filter input. |
| `Esc`        | Cancel the dialog.  |
